# Corridors of Time
A simple tool to map out the codes for the Corridor of Time puzzle.
This will read the JSON from [TLJ's site](https://tjl.co/corridors-of-time/). Simply put the JSON object into the array in the `codes.json` file and run the tool.
### How to run
1. Unzip the download
2. Run the appropriate script for your system (`.bat` for windows, the other for Linux/Mac)
   1. You can run this from either the `bin` folder or the root folder of the download.
   2. TL;DR You should be able to go into the `bin` folder and run the script no issue.
